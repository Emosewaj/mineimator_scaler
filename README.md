# Mine-imator Scaler

This program can be used to accuratly calculate the scale of a minecraft character with real sizes (in centimeters).

I know, you could also just use a calculator but sometimes people are lazy.

This repository contains code for a python version 2.x and 3.x

Use the 2.x code either with http://www.skulpt.org (erase demo code, paste my code, hit run, look at output) or with an installed 2.x python version.

Use the 3.x code with an installed 3.x python version.

Still no clue? Contact me on Kik: Emosewaj
